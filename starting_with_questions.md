Answer the following questions and provide the SQL queries used to find the answer.

    
**Question 1: Which cities and countries have the highest level of transaction revenues on the site?**


SQL Queries:

SELECT country, city, "totalTransactionRevenue" FROM all_sessions

ORDER by "totalTransactionRevenue" ASC



SELECT SUM ("totalTransactionRevenue"), country FROM all_sessions

GROUP by country ORDER by SUM ("totalTransactionRevenue")




Answer:

Top countries: USA, Israel, Australia, Canada, Switzerland
Top cities: San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Atlanta, Palo Alto, Tel Aviv-Yafo


**Question 2: What is the average number of products ordered from visitors in each city and country?**


SQL Queries:

SELECT city, country, AVG(units_sold) 
FROM all_sessions x
LEFT JOIN analytics y
ON x.full_visitor_id = y. full_visitor_id
GROUP BY city, country
ORDER BY AVG(units_sold) DESC NULLS LAST

Answer: data output points to the USA being the top consumer by far, with ~19.24 products ordered on average. Next highest country is Czechia with an average of ~15.19 products ordered, then a steep drop-off to Mexico with ~1.83. 32-way tie between countries with a single product ordered. 

**Question 3: Is there any pattern in the types (product categories) of products ordered from visitors in each city and country?**


SQL Queries:

SELECT country, city, v2_product_category, units_sold, x.full_visitor_id

FROM all_sessions x

LEFT JOIN analytics y

ON x.full_visitor_id = y.full_visitor_id

GROUP BY v2_product_category, country, city, units_sold, x.full_visitor_id
ORDER BY v2_product_category, units_sold DESC

NULLS LAST



Answer: Could not find any particular pattern. Too many missing values.



**Question 4: What is the top-selling product from each city/country? Can we find any pattern worthy of noting in the products sold?**


SQL Queries:

SELECT country, city, x.product_sku, y.units_sold, x.full_visitor_id, x.v2_product_name

FROM all_sessions x

LEFT JOIN analytics y

ON x.full_visitor_id = y.full_visitor_id

ORDER BY units_sold DESC

NULLS LAST


Answer: The United States accounts for the overwhelming majority of sales. There are cities in the US which are top in sales as well, but their data (or its data) is only listed as "not available in demo dataset." This would be the most notable pattern - that data for "city" is missing in many rows with significant sales numbers




**Question 5: Can we summarize the impact of revenue generated from each city/country?**

SQL Queries: 

SELECT country, city, sum((y.unit_price * y.units_sold)/1000000) as total_regional_revenue, x.full_visitor_id

FROM all_sessions x

LEFT JOIN analytics y

ON x.full_visitor_id = y.full_visitor_id

GROUP BY country, city, x.product_sku, x.full_visitor_id
ORDER BY total_regional_revenue DESC

NULLS LAST


Answer:

We can have an overview of the revenue generated from each city / country by outputting the product of quantity of each item ordered, multiplied by the (corrected) item price, then grouped by country and city. This also allows us to account for the revenue that is generated by a country but not attributed to any particular city, and vice-versa
