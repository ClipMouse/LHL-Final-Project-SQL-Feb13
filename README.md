# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
To perform the E-T-L (Extract-Transform-Load) process, and be able to use the outcome data to provide analysis
Develop a QA process

## Process
Step 1: Create and configure (settings, data types) new tables using PG Admin
Step 2: Import data to the tables
Step 3: Clean data (duplicates, missing values, formatting, etc.), manually or by code
Step 4: Prelimiary analysis of the tables and data, determine how the tables are related
Step 5: Answer questions using SQL code
Step 6: Develop a QA process

## Results

Data was largely sales and demographics info
Able to answer questions within those categories

## Challenges 

Technical difficulties loading the .CSV files
Data incomplete and requires significant cleaning or contemplating to use
(need to code around NULL values, standardize capitalization, adjust scales, etc.)

## Future Goals

Spend more time cleaning data
Better structure and organize tables
Employ more advanced SQL
Further research the significance of the data collected
