What issues will you address by cleaning the data?

Cleaning data helps to remove and/or reduce inaccuracies, duplicaties, missing values, formatting inconsistency, software incompatability, etc. for the purposes of more accurate, manageable, and clear data. 

Manual cleaning performed: renamed columns for consistency and to avoid errors caused by capitalization, changed column data type to allow for operations in excess of their existing capability (int changed to bigint). Deleted rows with no data


Queries:
Below, provide the SQL queries you used to clean your data.



To adjust for prices being 1,000,000 times too large:

SELECT unit_price/1000000 as true_unit_price FROM analytics


Wildcard % allows for any string

e.g. SELECT * FROM all_sessions

WHERE v2_product_name ILIKE '%Google%'


To find specific values (such as NULL or 0):

SELECT * FROM analytics

WHERE city is NULL



To find values containing a term:

SELECT * FROM analytics

WHERE city IN ("%not%")


To filter out duplicates:

SELECT DISTINCT 

To SELECT despite letter casing:

ILIKE
